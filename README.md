**Background of the SBA**: The U.S. Small Business Administration is an independent agency of the United States government that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses. The SBA provides loans through banks, credit unions and lenders who partner with the SBA
 
**Background of Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM)**: Focuses on the manufacturing sector as opposed to the SBA which includes all industries. This dataset gives insight to the manufacturing sector and includes data on expenses, capital expenditures (cost a company obtains to maintain, gain and improve assets) and inventory among other things. There seems to be many variables but that is due to a relative standard error that accompanies each category. For example Total fringe benefits , Relative S.E for total fringe benefits.. 

There also are letters throughout the data the representation of each letter is described below 
**D** - Withheld to avoid disclosing data of individual companies; data are included in higher level totals
**N** - Not available or not comparable
**S** - Estimate does not meet publication standards because of high sampling variability, poor response quality, or other concerns about the estimated quality. Unpublished estimates derived from this table by subtraction are subject to these same limitations and should not be attributed to the U.S. Census Bureau. For a description of publication standards and the total quantity response rate, see link to program methodology page.
**X** - Not applicable
**A** - Relative standard error of 100% or more
**r** - Revised (represented as a superscript)
**s** - Relative standard error is 40 percent or more and less than 100 percent (data variable displayed as a superscript)

*The analysis we do is to be taken lightly as there is definitely some bias due to confidentiality within the SBA and AMS data  (some companies may withhold information among other things).*
